            As a child I was the one who built the dens, the one who figured out the quickest 
            route to the shops to buy sweets and later, the pub. </p>

            <p className='text-center py-4 text-gray-500'>I love solving puzzles and have a love of computer games, particularly World of Warcraft, 
            that I balance with yoga and kickboxing. I am also an accomplished classical guitar teacher and performer.</p>

            <p className='text-center py-4 text-gray-500'>As a Front-end Developer with UI/UX qualifications, I can provide you and your business with user-centered 
            web applications.</p>
